## Config

The configuration keys are identical to the [configuration of ICantBelieveItsNotValetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/ICantBelieveItsNotValetudo/blob/master/README.md).
Please get the meaning for them from there.
It's normal that the structure of the addon differs from the official config file, this is nessesary because of the Supervisor Addon config structure.

If you use the Mosquitto Addon in Home Assistant `core-mosquitto` can be used as broker address like this: `mqtt://<user>:<password>@core-mosquitto`.
To use images as underlay or overlay, the `share` folder is mounted in the addon. Just start your path with `/share` to access it (example `/share/valetudo/underlay.png`)

If you are running Valetudo 2021_02 the Homeassitant Map Hack (Settings/MQTT) needs to be disable!
